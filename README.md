# Exercise-Session-Analysis-with-PY
This project involved analyzing and visualizing exercise session dataset using Python, focusing on key aspects like exercise duration, pulse rates, and calorie consumption to extract meaningful insights.

Key highlights of the project:

Data Cleaning: Converted and organized data for accurate analysis.
Visualization: Created insightful plots including line plots, bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps.
Insights: Identified trends and patterns in exercise metrics.
Iâ€™m grateful for the opportunity to apply my skills and learn from the experience.
